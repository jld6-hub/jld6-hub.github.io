I am a very cool person with absolutely no computer science knowledge.  If you're reading this it's actually a miracle, because it means I was somehow able to figire out how to make a blog post on my own website! Despite my lack of computuer knowledge, I pride myself on my creativity and willingness to try new things, and I hope to use that in a way I never have before in this class. I am looking forward to learning more about a field I've never explored. I can't wait to become a computer science genius, or at least become a little better at using my laptop.

**If you would like to learn more...**

## Here is more info about me!



My name is Justine, I am a junior. I am a comparative literature major and I play softball at Williams College.

I also sing in an acapella group and do improv, I love to perform, or at least try to!


I have very minimal sewing experience. I did a sewing camp when I was in the third grade where I learned to make my own skirt, but I have since lost that knowledge. I can fix my ripped clothes and small things like that, but I'm excited to learn how to embroider. 

I have no programming experience except when I had to use R in a class last year. I don't know if that counts but it was horrifying. 

Something boring about me is that I hate pickles. I think that's boring because there are some people who don't like pickles and some people who do, so I don't feel like that opinion is very special.
