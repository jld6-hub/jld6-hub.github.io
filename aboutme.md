I am a very cool person with absolutely no computer science knowledge. If you’re reading this it’s actually a miracle, because it means I was somehow able to figire out how to make a blog post on my own website! Despite my lack of computuer knowledge, I pride myself on my creativity and willingness to try new things, and I hope to use that in a way I never have before in this class. I am looking forward to learning more about a field I’ve never explored. I can’t wait to become a computer science genius, or at least become a little better at using my laptop.
